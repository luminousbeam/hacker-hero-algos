# HackerHero.com Algorithms

I'll be working through Michael Choi's [HackerHero](https://www.hackerhero.com/) the Learn to Code(Beginner), Basic Algorithm(Intermediate), Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures(Advanced) and Advanced Javascript algorithm sections on the website. 

I'm providing separate files for each algorithm with instruction and placeholder function within the Master branch and I'll be using different branches for Javascript ES5, ES6, Python, Ruby and perhaps Java later on :)
