// Threes and Fives

// Create threesFives(n) that adds values from 1 and n (inclusive) if that value is not divisible by 3 or 5. Return the final sum.

// For example, threesFives(10) returns 22 as it only returns the sum of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8. On that example, it skips 3, 6, 9 as those are divisible by 3. It also skips 5, and 10 as it's divisible by 5.

function threesFives(num){}

threesFives()

// Test Cases

// threesFives(10) to return 22

// threesFives(15) to return 60
