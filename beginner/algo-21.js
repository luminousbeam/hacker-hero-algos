// This Length, That Value

// Given two numbers passed to the function, return a new array of length num1 with each value num2. For example, thisLengthThatValue(3,5) should return [5, 5, 5]. thisLengthThatValue(2, 10) should return [10, 10].

function thisLengthThatValue(num1, num2) {}

thisLengthThatValue();
