// Be Positive

// Given an array, write a function that returns a new array where each negative value was converted to a positive value. For example, bePositive([-1,-3,-5]) returns [1, 3, 5]. A positive number in the original array should remain as positive, so that each number in the new array is all positive.

function bePositive(arr) {}

bePositive();
